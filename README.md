# Tkinter - Interior Decorator

This Tkinter GUI program is designed for you to get an estimation of the total cost of painting your room. This is done by taking the height & length and working out the area. After the area is worked out, the total price will be calculated depending on which of these options you chose. (Only one of the paint options will be selectable)

*Lxury Paint

Standard Paint

Economy Paint

Undercoat (optional)

Then the program will ask for these details:
Contact details (Name & Email) - to print on your receipt 
ISBN & Page number - To accurately match the colour you want, will ask you to provide a colour by telling us in which book it is in and which page. 

All inputs will be verified to make sure they are valid. If an input is not valid a suitable error message will ask you to fix the specified error.

Once you hit the green submit button a receipt will be generated with all the details.
